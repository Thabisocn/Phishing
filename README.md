# Types of Phishing emails

Phishing scams can come in a variety of types. Some phishing emails will ask you to click on a link to prevent your bank account or credit card from getting closed. When you click on the link, you’ll be taken to a website that asks for your personal financial information ,that could open the door to identity theft.Some other types of phishing attacks ask that you click on a link to verify that a credit card or bank account is yours.That link will take you to a fraudulent website that will ask you to provide sensitve information that will be captured by attackers.

My point is

 There are many types of phishing attacks. You need to be on the lookout for all of them but for this report we will only  be focusing on the 5 common types of Phishing.

 - Email Phishing
Attackers create emails that impersonate legitimate companies and attempt to steal your information

 - Spear Phishing
Its similiar to email phishing but the messages are more personalized.For example it may look like it comes from your Higher Up

 - Clone Phishing
Scammers replicate an email you have received, but now they include a dangerous attachment.


 - Whaling
Attackers target high ranking executives to gain access to their Sensitive data.This data is then used to launch an attack that could end up as an identity theft.

 - Pop-Up Phishing
Weird Pop-ups trick users into installing malware..


# Phishing in action

- Our attacker first begins by determining who their targeted victims will be (whether an organization or an individual) and specifically creates a plan to collect data.
- Our attacker creates methods like fake emails or Fake web pages to send messages that lure data from their victims.
- The attacker then send messages that appear trustworthy to the victims and begin the attack.
- Once the attack has been deployed, phishers will monitor and collect the data that victims provide on the fake web pages.
- Finally, phishers use the collected data to make illegal purchases,commit fraudulent acts and identity theft .


# How to spot Phishing emails

* Too Good To Be True - Phishing emails may try to hook a victim with what appears to be cheap offers for things like smartphones or vacations. DONT FALL FOR IT !!!!!
* Hyperlinks- If you receive an email that needs you to click on an unknown hyperlink, hovering over the link may show you that the link is really taking you to a fake, misspelled domain phishing scam.
* Spelling and grammatical mistakes
* Urgent deadlines - Attackers want you to act quickly, without thinking. That’s why many attackers will send emails asking you to immediately click on a link or send account information to avoid having your bank account or credit card suspended. Urgent requests for action are often phishing scams.
* Senders you think you recognize - You might get a phishing email from a name you recognize.That email may have come from the compromised email account of someone you know.(ke kgona go tsaya nako yame heela ke cheka gore ditsala tsa gago ke bo mang just to get to you. )
* Unrealistic financial rewards
* Mismatched URLs/ Domain name


# Preventing Phishing attacks

These are the techniques including best practices and tools that are largely used to stop phishing attacks and mitigate the effects of ones that do manage to bypass existing prevention mechanisms. 

```bash
# Comprehensive user education
$ Provide users with adequate education around perils of phishing, how to spot suspect communications and what to do once an attack has been identified.

# Don't open e-mails from senders you are not familiar with.

# Don't ever click on a link inside of an e-mail unless you know exactly where it's going.

# Mouseover the link to see if it's a legitimate link.

# Never enter personal information in pop-ups
$ Using Iframe technology, popups can easily capture personal information and send to a different domain.

```
